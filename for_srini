Hi Srini!
This is a file I added to our shared remote (online/cloud) repository's master branch.

To do this...

1) I PULL the remote repository's master branch (right-click => Team => Pull) into my local repository. 
	Doing this updates my workspace with the changes you committed and pushed to our remote repository's master branch.
	
2) Next, I make changes to my workspace and commit those changes to my local repository.

3) Next, there's some changes in another branch (mknBranch) that I want to add to our master repo.
	Specifically, there's this for_srini.txt file I want to add.
	So, since I've committed my changes from mknBranch to my local repository, I'm going to merge my local mknBranch with my local master branch
		Remember! My local master branch holds the same content as the remote repository's master branch because I just pulled it!
	
4) If there are any conflicts, I will resolve those. Then, I will push my new master branch (with the new file for_srini.txt I merged in)

The changes from my branch are now integrated into our master branch, and our work is now one coherent branch
